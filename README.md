# Shipments
 
This is a simple Java Programm which administrates shipments in different branches. The shipments can be from Greece or from aboard.
The cost of the shipment is different and depends on the country. Also, there is a window that the user can select a branch and calculate 
how the total cost is. That project has created for IDE Learn plugin testing purpose.
